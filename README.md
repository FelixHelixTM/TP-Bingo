Bingo uses a racefile, which is basically a file that has the world open from the start of the game.

Setting up a racefile:
A racefile can be made using the TP randomizer, go here for a guide on installing it: https://rando.zeldatp.net/

Once you've done that, use the following settings to set up an un-randomized racefile:

Page 2/11:
Rando enabled? = No

Page: 6/11:
Set everything to No

Page 7/11:
Set everything to Yes

Page 8/11:
Set everything to Yes

Page 9/11:
Set GM Story flag and Start W/ Crstl to Yes, leave Hidden Skills as No

Known bugs with TP Rando:
At the moment, having "Rando enabled? = No" causes a couple of issues, specifcally when collecting hidden skills, or when going through Snowpeak Ruins.
You can get around this by opening the rando menu, and changing "Rando enabled? = No" to "Rando enabled? = Yes", and going through a load zone.
Make sure to do this before collecting a hidden skill, so it will actually be added to your inventory.
Make sure to do the same for Snowpeak Ruins if you intend to do it glitchless.
Afterwards, you can just set "Rando enabled?" back to No, and go through a load zone to apply it.
